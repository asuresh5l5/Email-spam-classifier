1. **Import Libraries**:
   - The first cell imports essential libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`. These are widely used for numerical computations and data manipulation.

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The dataset `spam.csv` is loaded using `pandas`, and the first few rows are displayed using `df.head()`.

3. **Checking the Dataset Shape**:
   - The shape of the dataset is retrieved to understand the number of rows and columns.


4. **Markdown: Data Cleaning**:
   - A markdown cell introduces the concept of data cleaning, which is a necessary step before performing any analysis.
 

5. **Exploring Dataset Information**:
   - The `df.info()` command is used to display information about the dataset, including column names, non-null values, and data types.

  
6. **Markdown: Drop Last Three Columns**:
   - Another markdown cell explains that the last three unnamed columns will be dropped because they are not useful for this analysis.

 
7. **Dropping Unwanted Columns**:
   - The three columns named `Unnamed: 2`, `Unnamed: 3`, and `Unnamed: 4` are removed as they contain irrelevant data.

 
8. **Sample of Data**:
   - The `sample()` method is used to display 5 random samples from the dataset to get a quick look at how it appears after dropping the columns.
 

9. **Renaming Columns**:
   - The columns are renamed for better understanding:
     - `v1` is renamed to `target` (this column holds the "spam" or "ham" label).
     - `v2` is renamed to `text` (this column contains the actual message).

10. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - The text is likely cleaned further ( Lower case,Tokenization,Removing special characters,Removing stop words and punctuation,Stemming.).
    - The target variable (labels "spam" and "ham") might be encoded to numeric values for machine learning models.

11. **Splitting Data**:
    - The dataset would be split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

12. **Model Building**:
    - A machine learning model (like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression) would be trained to classify SMS messages as spam or ham.
  
13. **Evaluation**:
    - The model's performance would be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
